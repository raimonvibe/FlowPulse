Last updated: January 28, 2026

FlowPulse is a minimal productivity app developed by RaimonVibe. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.

**1. Information We Collect**

We collect only the minimum data required for core functionality:

- Account data (email, if you create an account for cross-device sync)  
- Usage data (Pomodoro session timers, focus statistics, blocked apps/sites preferences, habit tracking entries)  
- Device information (type, OS version for app compatibility)

No location data, contacts, photos, microphone, camera, or other sensitive permissions are accessed unless explicitly granted by you.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

- Provide and improve app features (sync across devices, adaptive Pomodoro, focus reports)  
- Analyze anonymized usage to enhance performance and fix issues  
- Communicate updates or support responses (if you contact us)

**3. Data Sharing**

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing.

Limited sharing occurs only with:  
- Cloud sync provider (for cross-device functionality, encrypted)  
- Analytics tools (anonymized, aggregated only)  
- Legal requirements (if compelled by law)

**4. Data Storage & Security**

Data is stored securely on encrypted servers. Sync uses industry-standard encryption. We implement reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access.

You may:  
- Request access, correction, or deletion of your data
