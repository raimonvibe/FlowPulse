## What is FlowPulse?  

A single-page showcase wrapped around **HTML5 UP’s Helios** template—stripped back, tuned up, and turned into something that feels like a living pulse.  
Think of it as the homepage your fantasy app deserves: fast, mobile-ready, zero bloat, infinite scroll illusions.  

No databases. No backend. Just HTML, CSS, a sprinkle of jQuery, and enough animations to make the cursor feel drunk on code.

## Why I Built It  

- **Speed first.** Loads before your coffee cools.  
- **Looks good everywhere.** Phone, fridge display, whatever. Retina, landscape, portrait—it shrugs.  
- **No gatekeepers.** If you know how to copy, paste and push, you can clone this and ship your idea today.

## What You Get  

- Clean one-pager with parallax sections (toggleable)  
- Hero image, stats grid, timeline, contact form (Formspree plug-in)  
- Font Awesome icons, smooth scroll, lazy-load feel  
- Responsive nav that collapses into a burger with zero tears
